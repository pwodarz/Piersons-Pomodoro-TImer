## .exe (Windows Only)
To run, download and run the provided exe.
Note: It is unlikely your Windows Defender will allow you to execute this program without advanced configuration (read more [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/information-about-the-attachment-manager-in-microsoft-windows-c48a4dcd-8de5-2af5-ee9b-cd795ae42738)). As such, this method is not suggested, but meant to demonstrate the capacity to build .exe files from .py files.
